Simple Todo Application developed using TDD and the tools/techniques seen at the Advanced Techniques and Tools for Software Development course at Universit√† degli Studi di Firenze, using Maven and GitHub Workflows.

## Prerequisites
- Java 8
- Maven
- Docker (for the MongoDB container if you want to run the application as standalone)

A GitHub repository is also required for Continuous Integration on GitHub Workflows, if you want to execute remotely tests, code coverage with Coveralls and code quality analysis with SonarCloud; otherwise, all tests, mutation testing and JaCoCo code coverage can also be executed locally during the Maven build. To execute code quality analysis locally, a [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/downloads/) installation is required and the plugin must be configured accordingly (more details on the [official documentation](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/)).

### How to setup a MongoDB docker container with a replica set
Since a MongoDB database with transactions support is required to try the application, here are two different ways to setup a working MongoDB instance with its replica set, implying a Docker installation is already present.

#### Using the official Mongo docker image
In this case, the configuration is slightly more complex since we have to create a more production-friendly setup with at least two nodes, one with a primary role and one with a secondary role that replicates all the content of the primary node.
 1. `docker pull mongo:latest` to download the latest MongoDB docker image
 2. `docker network create mongo-network` to create a Docker network named "mongo-network" for MongoDB instances to communicate
 3. `docker run -p 27017:27017 --name mongo-primary --net mongo-network mongo:latest mongod --replSet todoapp-replica-set` to create a MongoDB docker container on the created network; finally, it invokes the Mongo daemon to add the instance to a replica set called "todoapp-replica-set"
 4. `docker run -p 27018:27017 --name mongo-secondary --net mongo-network mongo:latest mongod --replSet todoapp-replica-set` to create another MongoDB docker container for the secondary instance for the replica set

Then, we have to setup the replica set so that the two instances act as primary and secondary nodes. To do this, we connect to the Mongo shell of the primary node with `docker exec -it mongo-primary mongo` and we create the following configuration:

 1. `db = (new Mongo('localhost:27017')).getDB('todoapp')` to create the database that will be used by the application
 2. `configuration = {"_id": "todoapp-replica-set", "members": [{"_id": 0, "host": "mongo-primary:27017"}, {"_id": 1, "host": "mongo-secondary:27017"}]}` creates a configuration with the two instances, from the set network, as nodes of the replica set
 3. `rs.initiate(configuration)` to initiate the replica set with the given configuration

Now the replica set has been initialized and configured and the application can be started. The replica set URl to pass to the application will be `mongodb://localhost:27017`.

#### Using a third-party Mongo docker image (not recommended)
1. `docker pull krnbr/mongo:latest` to download the latest MongoDB custom docker image; this image has a pre-configured built-in replica set on a single node, acceptable for testing purposes but highly not recommended for production purposes because of its instability at runtime
2. `docker run -p 27017:27017 --name mongo krnbr/mongo:latest` to create a MongoDB docker container using this custom docker image (no additional configuration required)

Since this image uses a version of MongoDB < 4.2, it does not support the creation of collections during transactions, so there are some additional steps:
1. `docker exec -it mongo mongo` to connect to the Mongo shell of the database
2. `db = (new Mongo('localhost:27017')).getDB('todoapp')` to create the database that will be used by the application
3. `db.createCollection('tasks')` and `db.createCollection('tags')` to create both collections of the database

The single-node replica set has been initialized and the application can be started, passing `mongodb://localhost:27017` as replica set URL to the application.

## Build with Maven
- `mvn clean verify` to simply run all tests
- `mvn clean verify org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage` to run all tests and perform mutation testing

Add `-Pjacoco` to also generate the code coverage report made by Jacoco during the build process.
Note that the replica set setup is not needed for Maven builds, since all tests use Testcontainers for the MongoDB database instance.

### Run the application
Once the application has been packaged with `mvn clean package`, the .jar contaning backend and frontend can be found in `/simpletodoapp-gui/target`. Use `java -jar <path_to_jar> [options]` to run the application.
| Option name | Description |
|-|-|
| `--mongo-url` | URL of the replica set, by default `mongodb://localhost:27017`; obtainable as `mongodb://localhost:[primary_node_port_number]` |
| `--db-name` | Database name, as specified during the replica set setup phase, by default `todoapp` |
| `--db-tasksCollection` | Name of the tasks collection in the database, by default `tasks` |
| `--db-tagsCollection` | Name of the tags collection in the database, by default `tags` |

## Continuous integration
The .yml workflow file to perform continuous integration on the project with GitHub Workflows is provided in the repository; if you want to also check the Coveralls and Sonarcloud status, some environment variables need to be modified inside the .yml workflow file:

 - `SONAR_PROJECT`: given by Sonarcloud during the initialization phase
 - `SONAR_ORGANIZATION`: given by Sonarcloud during the initialization phase
 - `SONAR_URL`: given by Sonarcloud during the initialization phase
 - `SONAR_TOKEN`: given by Sonarcloud during the initialization phase; this needs to be set as a GitHub Secret
 - `GITHUB_TOKEN`: set by default by GitHub as secret
 - `COVERALLS_TOKEN`: given by Coveralls during the initialization phase; this needs to be set as a GitHub Secret

To setup a token/key as secret in GitHub, simply go to the repository **Settings** and then select **Secrets**; alternatively, if code quality and coverage analyses are not needed, simply remove the `sonar:sonar coveralls:report` goals from the Maven build inside the .yml workflow file.
